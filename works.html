                        Worked as a solo developer in short time window (less than a month). Built off of a pre-existing template this project was about adding on top 
                        to make unique and interesting changes to gameplay, art, or sound. Overhauled the UI by upgrading the text and changing the UI layout. 
                        Added a loading screen system where scenes would be loaded asynchronously and would begin loading after the transition completes. 
                        Designed one big entire level around new added mechanics on top of the base. Added a dive mechanic where one can bounce off of enemies higher than jumping will. 
                        Added extra 'feel' to the game with camera shake and parallax.
